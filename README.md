Lean Startup Canvas is mainly intended to Capture your business model in a portable 1-page diagram. 
The Lean Canvas is the perfect format for brainstorming possible business models,prioritizing where to start, and tracking ongoing learning.

LEAN CANVAS SECTIONS: OVERVIEW

1. THE PROBLEM 
The starting point is the problem, the need to be satisfied. Without problem there is no solution and no reason for the startup to exist. 
> Describe the practical problem and when it is felt by the customer.

2. CUSTUMER TARGET 
Who feels the need? Who are our customers, ie those who pay for our product or service? Do they coincide with the users?
> Define the possible customers, subdividing them in segments – who is our target? Don’t be too generic, concentrate on those who will first adopt the product/service.

3. THE SOLUTION
How do we respond to the need with our product/service? 
> Explain practically how the product/service works and the benefits it gives.

4. VALUE PROPOSITION 
What’s the value we’re proposing to our customers? Or, with other words, how do we create value for them and why we’re doing it in a unique way, differently from our competitors? Why should the customer choose us? 
> Better define the competitive advantage.

5. REVENUE STREAM 
Where do our revenues come from? When and for what are our customers paying us? 
> Define the revenue sources, being as explicit as possible.

6. PROPRIETARY ADVANTAGE 
Which proprietary advantage can we count on? Which is, why our product/service can’t be imitated cheaply by someone else? 
> Define (if present) the resources that exclusively belong to us (eg. Patents, new technology, personal network with fundamental partners)

7. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Which are the channels through which we can acquire customers? Are they affordable? 
> Specify as much as possible how you will be able to contact the target customers.

8. KEY METRICS
How do we measure the success (or failure) of our business? 
> Define the fundamental parameters.

9. COST STRUCTURES
Where do our cost arise? 
> Specify as much as possible the cost centers, distinguishing fixed and variable cost.
